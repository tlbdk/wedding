        Following 3 days of active case solving, enthusiastic dancing and pleasant socializing, Troels left Riga with a winner’s title of the Peak Time competition and Aisma’s e-mail address (Aisma insists the two are not related), whilst Aisma could gaze into the compass Troels gifted her before departing (one of the prizes of the competition) and reminisce of the very tall and very blonde foreigner she was not expecting to ever see again.

        Fast-forwarding a few years (spoiler alert: they did meet again) and locations (Portugal, Norway, Denmark, UK, Århus*, China) ahead, here they were, in Shanghai, China in September 2012, putting an end to their very long long-distance relationship, and heading back to Copenhagen together.</p>

        <p>And now, in 2015, having spent more than 9 years together** and not yet gotten sick of each other, Troels and Aisma decided they might as well tie the knot.
